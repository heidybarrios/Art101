    <h1>Lab 11: Libraries and jQuery</h1>

     <div id="challenge">
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
<p> The challange I had was with jQuery code, I founf it harder because of all the
  extra "()" "{}" it was easy to miss them. </p>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> I tried to debug as much as possible. Running my code in the console also helps catch anything I miss.
  It was time-consuming going back and forth. This lab did take more time since it was a lot of back and forth between
  console and atom.</p>
