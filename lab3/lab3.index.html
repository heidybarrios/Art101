		<h1>File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<p> The idea of this lab was to add more index.html files and create a local life
			on my computer. </p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> For the most part I was able to create a file structure but I wasn't able to create all the folders undermy finder.
				All my files are spread in their indivual folders. I did find myself going back and forth with the lectures to help guide me. I was able to finally do index.html files and checking my browser for any
				mistakes. I was able to create all the folders for my file structure in the folders!!
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> I have attached my index.html (screenshots) that I created, although like I stated before I had a hard time creating the folders on my finder but I was able to figure it out.
