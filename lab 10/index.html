    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p> The challenge I had was not being able to fully do the sort name button.
      I decided to do a simple input name that I got from W3 schools</p>
    <!-- https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_name.asp  -->
    <p> I tried to use the example from Wes's (it looks more advance) and I couldn't
      do it. </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p> The only problem I had was trying to do the bonus task. I tried to do glitch effect
      that took some time.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>You can see my free labour power.</p>


<p>Enter a text/name in the box and see your name.</p>
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <div id="output"></div>
