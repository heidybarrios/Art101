    <h1>Challenges</h1>
<p> The challenges I had in the beginning is not knwoing what I wanted to do for the
  everyday task and coming up with a good level task example. Also, it took me longer
  to do this assignment becuase for a long time I thought I had to actually make
  a tic-tac-toe game on html. The other challenge I had was linking my CSS and HTML and
  going back and forth to seeing the changes I was making.
 </p>

<h1>Problems</h1>
<p> One of the problems I had was trying to edit alot on CSS (Im still not the best)
  but I am now more comfortable using CSS after not being able to use the right tags
  to specific tags. One specific problem I had was trying to add a title page
  in the top of my page which I was able to fix!
</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p> The results of my work is seen in my screenshots of my work and the tags I used to create
  my page. Using CSS I was able to edit my page and like the final results.
