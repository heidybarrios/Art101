			<p> Hi, this is all about me.</p>
			<p>	It's my first coding class and the first time
				I created something like this. Unfournately, I didn't
				have a partner for this lab. I was able to follow the lecture
				that Professor Wes provided to help guide me. I was able to change the font
				and change the color and customize my website.</p>
