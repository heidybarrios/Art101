  <h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p> The challenge I had for this lab was the FizzBuzz function. Even with
    following how Wes's demonstrate in class it didn't work. I had to use other tools;
    like W3 to figure it out why it wasn't working.</p>

    <h2>Promblems</h2>
    <p>Like I said above the only problem was running the FizzBuzz function in the console.
      After, I was able to loop numbers 1 to 200, and the multiples of 3, 5, 7.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p> Here are my reuslts for Loops!</p>

    <p>Here is the output of my JavaScript code:</p>
