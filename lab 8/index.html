    <h1>Lab 8: Anonymous Functions and Callbacks</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p> I had some issues with the test part I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get it to
      work for me. I was following Wes's example but I couldn't get it to work. I
      watched a couple of Youtube videos that seemed easier to use var for the testing part.</p>
    <h2> Problems</h2>
    <p> I had problems with the Anonymous fucnntions I had a hard time with the coding.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p> You can see my results with my JavaScript code and my console!!.</p>
    <h2>EXTRA</h2>
