    <h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
    One of the challenges I had was the script output, it was not working for me.
    The issue was in my JavaScript, I had only two h1 and h2 (im guessing it didn't know how to read which tag)
    because I tend to only use two [h1,h2].</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I had an issue with the outputEl.appendChild. In my console I kept getting an error that I couldn't figure out /:
    I try to debug as much as I can but also was hard to figure out what exactly the
    lab prompt wanted. I tried to follow the Lab 9 module (hopefully is right).</p>
